# About Chishiki.AI

Welcome to Chishiki.AI, a transformative project at the forefront of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE). Chishiki.AI, meaning 'knowledge through AI,' is a pioneering initiative funded by the National Science Foundation and led by a team of experts at the University of Texas at Austin.

## Our Vision and Mission

At Chishiki.AI, our mission is to revolutionize CEE research and practice through the powerful integration of AI. We strive to create a sustainable, diverse, and integrated community of CyberInfrastructure Professionals (CIPs) and domain experts. Our project aligns with the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 and the 2022 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, reflecting our commitment to maintaining US leadership in AI and enhancing infrastructure resilience.

## Strategic Approach

Our innovative strategies focus on:

* **Deepening Collaboration**: We foster collaborative research through initiatives like the CIP Summer Academy and Hackathon, promoting interdisciplinary teams to drive innovations in CEE.

* **AI-Powered Learning Environments**: Chishiki.AI offers a scalable, personalized learning platform, enhancing CEE education through AI-enhanced training and mentoring.

* **Innovative CI Architectures**: We develop AI-enabled computational infrastructures for efficient and reproducible workflows, optimizing high-performance computing systems for CEE applications.

* **Fostering Diversity**: Engaging with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), we aim to build a more inclusive CIP community.

## Educational Innovations

We introduce cutting-edge courses covering topics like AI for CI, CI for AI, and Scientific Machine Learning, designed to bridge the gap between AI and CEE. These courses, alongside our novel AI tutor system, offer personalized educational experiences, catering to individual needs and abilities.

## Research and Development

Chishiki.AI is committed to developing groundbreaking AI applications in CEE. Our focus areas include AI-accelerated simulations, foundational AI models for structural health monitoring, and knowledge discovery in natural hazards engineering. These initiatives aim to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of CEE practices.

## Community Impact

Our goal is to impact over 500 CIPs nationwide and train more than 300,000 users globally. We are dedicated to democratizing access to AI-enhanced CI innovations and ensuring broad adoption across the CEE sector.
