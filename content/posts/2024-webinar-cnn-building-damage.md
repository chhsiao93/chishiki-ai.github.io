## Description:
This webinar will guide you through building and deploying effective Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automated building damage identification.  We'll cover image classification techniques, CNN fundamentals, and hands-on experience to empower you with the skills to scale your solutions.

## Key Topics:
* **Understanding Image Classification and CNNs:** Explore basic machine learning models, Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and the core components of CNNs for image analysis.
* **The Building Blocks of CNNs:** Delve into the essential elements of CNNs, including convolutional layers, pooling, activation functions, and more.
* **Training Deep Learning Models:** Learn strategies for effectively training your models, including data augmentation and transfer learning techniques.
* **Workflow for Deep Learning:** Gain practical knowledge with a step-by-step deep learning workflow.
* **Case Study: Natural Hazard Detection:** See real-world applications of CNNs for building damage identification after natural disasters.
* **Hands-on Session:** Get hands-on experience building and deploying a CNN for damage classification using PyTorch.
* **Homework:** Solidify your knowledge with engaging homework assignments.


## Prerequisites: 
Basic understanding of Python programming is recommended but not essential.
