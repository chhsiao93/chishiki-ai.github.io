Chishiki-AI is thrilled to announce the launch of new research opportunities in collaboration with SCIPE (Strengthening the Cyberinfrastructure Professionals Ecosystem) focusing on Artificial Intelligence in Civil Engineering. This initiative is supported by NSF funding and is dedicated to fostering the next generation of experts in this dynamic field.

The SCIPE AI in Civil Engineering fellowship and scholarship programs provides a year-long opportunity for graduate students, and a summer-long opportunity for undergraduate students, to develop advanced Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Infrastructure for applications in Civil Engineering and collaborate with experts at The University of Texas at Austin and Texas Advanced Computing Center. The graduate students will remain at their respective institutions during the year of funding and will take online courses/webinars during the year. The graduate students are required to participate in an intensive two-week summer training on AI/CyberInfrastructure at UT Austin. 

Potential application areas of AI in Civil Engineering include, but are not limited to, computer vision techniques for structural health monitoring, automation in construction, robotics in extreme environments, AI-accelerated simulations, AI-enabled knowledge discovery, AI for natural hazards engineering, and AI for mobility, water, and energy.
