# Research Summit

> April 4th and 5th, 2024.

We are organizing a Research Summit on Crosscutting Research Needs for AI in Civil Engineering as a part of our NSF Strengthening Cyber Infrastructure Professional Ecosystem (SCIPE) Chishiki AI in Civil Engineering Program. The primary goal of the workshop is to identify common research gaps across AI algorithm developments, cyberinfrastructure needs, and civil engineering that may benefit from interdisciplinary research efforts. This research summit focuses on five theme areas: AI and Cyber Infrastructure in Construction Automation, Smart Cities, Sensing, Energy, and Natural Disasters. The workshop outputs will be disseminated as a white paper highlighting grand research challenges and pathways to AI in civil engineering.


## Location

The two-day workshop will be held April 4-5, 2024, in person at the Texas Advanced Computing Center - TACC, UT Austin, TX. 

10505 Exploration Way, Austin, TX 78758

## AGENDA

**Day 1: Fostering Collaboration and Developing a Roadmap**
We will organize a series of presentations from leading CI, AI, and Civil Engineering experts. We will also have interactive workshops and panel discussions. The primary focus will be identifying and addressing common research gaps across AI algorithm developments, CI needs, and civil engineering. We aim to facilitate an environment that fosters collaboration between CI Professionals (CIPs) and domain experts.
 
**Day 2: Technical Deep Dives and Actionable Strategies**
The day will begin with technical sessions focusing on CIP developments to achieve AI in Construction Automation, Smart Cities, Sensing, and Natural Disasters. We will transition into a series of roundtable discussions aimed at developing new algorithms, frameworks, and tools. These collaborative sessions will be critical in exploring potential bottlenecks and devising strategies to support CI and CIPs development for AI in Civil Engineering.

The summit will conclude with a session dedicated to summarizing the discussions and outlining a roadmap for shaping the future of the CIP Ecosystem around AI in Civil Engineering.
